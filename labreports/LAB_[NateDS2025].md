| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  |  2 | I sort of did a good job of valuing my time. Some things were hard to get through in a timely manner. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |  2 | I feel like it sort of did make the important steps and information clear. I also felt that it was hard to see it at times. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? |  2.7 | It did lead me to where I wanted to head towards. The only thing is that it was a little hard to navigate. |

| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow/navigation of the site? |  2.5 | Workflow/navigation of this site was understandable and decent but not the best. Some things like the filtering could be fixed a little. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |  2 | I think it is accessible in a mouse-less interface but not a screen reader interface. I say that because the home page really clutters a lot. |
| **TOTAL** |  14.8 | The website is a decent job search but could definitely use some fixing. |
